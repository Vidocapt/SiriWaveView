## Overview 

This is a very simple implementation of the Siri waveform in iOS9+ made with SwiftUI. The math behind the waveform is based on a great article which [can be found here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-built-siriwavejs-library-maths-and-code-behind-6971497ae5c1/) that explains the math and builds a Siri waveform in Javascript.

## Installation

To install, simply drag and drop the `SwiftUI-SiriWaveView/SiriWaveView` folder into your project (NOTE: Make sure you add it to the proper target(s) in XCode)
